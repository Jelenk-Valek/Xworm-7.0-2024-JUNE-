**New added features**
----
This version has 5 new added features
1) **Executable Injection**: Injects itself into other executable files, enabling the RAT to spread and operate under the guise of legitimate applications.
2) **Network Traffic Interception**: Intercepts and analyzes network traffic to monitor communications or redirect connections, useful for man-in-the-middle attacks.
3) **Network Scanning**: Scans local and remote networks to identify other vulnerable devices, which can then be targeted for further compromise.
4) **Rootkit Capabilities**: Can hide its own processes, files, and network connections from the operating system and security software, making detection and removal much more difficult.
5) **Image Injection**: Embeds malicious code within image files, exploiting vulnerabilities in image processing software to execute the code when the image is opened.
